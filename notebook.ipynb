    "With the ease of booking and canceling hotel reservations online, hotel cancelations and no-shows have drastically increased. This poses a significant problem for hotel revenue. Hotels are losing out on money when there are vacant rooms due to last minute cancellations. To combat this issue, I am going to create a model that can predict when a customer is going to cancel their reservation. This will allow the hotel to overbook an appropriate number of rooms so that they are not losing out on money due to vacant rooms while also not booking more rooms than there is space for in the hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders for this project are the hotel employees in charge of hotel bookings and operations, including the Reservations Manager, VP of Operations and, and VP of Revenue Management.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business problem is important to the stakeholders because it is crucial to increase revenue coming from hotel room bookings. Additionally, they need to accurately manage vacancies for guests, which also impact the price of the rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this business problem, I will investigate the following 3 questions:\n",
    "1. What factors contribute to **hotel cancellations**?\n",
    "2. What factors contribute to **maintaining a hotel reservation**?\n",
    "3. How can hotels strategically price rooms to **increase revenue**?"
